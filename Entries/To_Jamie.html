            <h4>Entry Title: To Jamie</h4>
            <p class="letter">Jamie, if you’re reading this… I’m sorry.
                I tried. I really tried. I thought I could wield it, control it, bend it to my will. I thought I could avenge Sarah, Timmy, 
                the others… make those rotten bastards pay for what they did to us.
                <br><br>
                But God I was wrong.. so so wrong. 
                <br><br>
                I thought I could make things better, so that no one would have to experience what they did to us. 
                I thought.. i- i just couldn't do anything about it. It's eating away at me slowly.
                <br><br>
                I'm sorry jamie, i thought i was doing the right thing by avenging them, but what ive unleashed is far worse.
                <br><br>
