            <h4>Entry Title: Job Promotion</h4>
            <p class="letter">I can't believe it, but I just got a promotion at my workplace. I got promoted to being a manager, apparently the old manager died 
                due to mugging. I feel bad for him, I'm not sure if this was the result of my prosperity ritual or another dumb coincidence.. I hope that it was 
                just some dumb coincidence, I can't bear the thought that my hands had involvement in his murder.. on the other hand I feel quite hopeful. Could 
                this mean that the ritual actually worked?
                <br><br>
                I think that there is still hope in the grimoire. I'll keep researching it. Though there's something else I almost forgot to mention.. Ever since 
                a few days ago, animals started behaving hostile against me. The neighbor's dog that seemed docile usually now barks and growls whenever I pass by. 
                Not sure if it has any ties to this.
