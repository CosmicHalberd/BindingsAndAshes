            <h4>Entry Title: Entry 7? 8? I'm not sure anymore</h4>
            <p class="letter">I had been so consumed by my studies about the grimoire, I forgot to document my findings. My supervisor threatened to fire me if I dont "change". 
                What "change" is he talking about? I haven't changed, I mean yeah I sort of neglected my work, but I'm still me. I haven't change. I'm still the same. Maybe he is 
                seeing things or maybe he is jealous of me.
                <br><br>
                On a side note, tommorow I will be conducting my biggest ritual yet. The dreams still haunts me, the guilt and anguish still lingers. 
                I need to make them pay for what they did. I musn't forget the reason why I even have this grimoire in the first place.
                <br><br>
                I hope to see the Duke of Discord.
