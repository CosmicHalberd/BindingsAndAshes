            <h4>Entry Title: My First Ritual</h4>
            <p class="letter">The book is quite comprehensive. It has rituals ranging from small charms to more complex and demanding rituals. After reading
                 some more, I tried a ritual that supposedly calls on rain. It required simple materials like dirt, water, and stones. Though on my first attempt 
                 nothing seemed to happen. Second attempt, no luck. Third, the same as the first two. Maybe I did something wrong, or maybe it really is just some dumb 
                 fairy tale.
                 <br><br>
                 I mean, what fool would believe that chanting words while holding a bowl of water would somehow make the weather rain. Though for a moment I 
                 felt like someone was watching me, must be just my imagination.
