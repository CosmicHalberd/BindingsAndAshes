            <h4>Entry Title: I'm sorry</h4>
            <p class="letter">I wasn't sure how long I would be able to hold out for. I can feel it.. he broke something in me.. the voices. I wish i had never touched 
                that grimoire. I have nothing now, my relationships, my job, my family, i have nothing.
                <br><br>
                Last night he spoke to me, i ended up making a pact with him. That is the reason of this website's existence. He needed a vessel to operate his influence 
                in the mortal world. He needed.. someone.
                <br><br>
                if you are that someone, im sorry. he wouldnt leave me alone until he can find other vessels. i have barely anything left in my life, i at least want to have 
                my mind to myself. im not sure if it will make anything better though.. the damage has already been done. the grimoire.. i need to burn it. i need to.. destroy it.
                 the ink, its like its alive.. its evil. he is evil. that book is evil. that shopkeeper is evil. i understand now why he gave it to me. they are all evil. im evil. 
                 im sorry. im sorry i had to do his bidding. i know im evil. im sorry.
