            <h4>Entry Title: Duke of Discord</h4>
            <p class="letter">I DID WHAT IT ASKED ME TO, SO WHY IS HE TORMENTING ME?! I did as he asked me to, I brought the goat blood, the cemetery dirt, 
                the spoiled apple, and all the other things. He asked me to acknowledge him and I DID. SO WHY IS HE NOT DOING AS I INTEDED HIM TO DO?? I acknowledged. 
                I.. acknowledged.. him. I- Oh God. Oh God. By acknowledging him.. I gave him an entrance to my soul.. the book warned me about it THE BOOK WARNED ME ABOUT IT.
                It's over. My life is over.
                <br><br>
                I can already feel his influence inside my mind. These voices that don't belong to me.
